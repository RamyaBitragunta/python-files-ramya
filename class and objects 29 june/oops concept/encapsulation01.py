"""encapsulation is the most important principle in the object oriented programming language.
(4 concepts or 4 pillars in OOPL- they are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism
Procedural - programming- divided the program into set of functions. so the data is stored in a bunch of variables
and the functions operate on data.As the programs grow there will be lots of functions -and there will be
interdependency b/w the functions- which becomes problematic
In oops- we combine related variables and functions into a unit and we call that unit as objects.
we refer variables as properties and the functions as method
so in oopl- we group varaibles and functions that operate on them into objects -this is called encapsulation.
This can prevent the data being modified by accident- encapsulation
Encapsulation can be achieved using private variables and private methods.

#example- we have three variables-
#  basesalary = 30,000
#  overtime = 10
#  rate =20  # basesalary +(overtime * rate)
#calculate the wage of an employee
