# Inheritance is a way by which a subclass can inherit the attributes and methods of another class.
# the new class is called derived or child class and the one from which
# it inherits is called base class or parent class

""" Advantages
REusability of code
Structured code - by dividing code into classes, we can structure our own software better
by dividing functionality into classes."""

# Hierarchical Inheritance
# Hierarchical Inheritance involves multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base
# eg; if A is parent class, B is subclass derived from A and also,
# C is also a subclass derived from A
# i.e one parent class having multiple sub-classes.

#hybrid- inheritance- combination of atleast two Inheritance types.
