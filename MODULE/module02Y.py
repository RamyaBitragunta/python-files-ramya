""" Module is apythoon file(.py) containing a set of functions that we want to include in our application

 A module's contents are accessed with the import statement.
  suppose- we have a main python file(main module) and we have different multiple functions in dif files
   and again each and other dif file is a python file (these files are called modules) and we can call all these
   modules from the main module.(so we can split the complete code into dif files(modules)
   """
