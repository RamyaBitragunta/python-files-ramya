# CAN U DENOTE THE WORKING OF BOOL FUNCTION WITH EXAMPLES

# bool() function
# the bool function in python returns either logical True or False
# it cannot output anything else apart from the logical operation

a = "Hello"
b = 15
c = 0
sample_list = []
print(bool(a))
print(bool(b))
print(bool(c))
print(bool(sample_list))

# boolean function functionality provide output True as default unless it sees none, null, 0 , or empty list or set
# etc.for this it gives False..apart from these everything is True
